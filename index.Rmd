Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills,
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less
time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for those interested
in working with ecology data in R.

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 6 hours). They start with
some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through
how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors,
how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a
data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting. The last lesson demonstrates
how to work with databases directly from R.

This lesson assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio and no programming
experience.
