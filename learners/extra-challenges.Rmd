## Challenge: `ggplot2` syntax

There are some issues with these `ggplot2` examples.
Can you figure out what is wrong with each one?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length, color = "blue")) +
  geom_point()
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Our points don't actually turn out blue, because we defined the color inside of `aes()`.
`aes()` is used for translating variables from the data into plot elements, like color.
There is no variable in the data called "blue".

::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = "weight", y = "hindfoot_length")) +
  geom_point()
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Variable names inside `aes()` should not be wrapped in quotes.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) 
  + geom_point()
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

When adding things like `geom_` or `scale_` functions to a `ggplot()`, you have to end a line with `+`, not begin a line with it.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys, x = weight, y = hindfoot_length) +
  geom_point()
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

When translating variables from the data, like `weight` and `hindfoot_length`, to elements of the plot, like `x` and `y`, you must put them inside `aes()`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length, color = species_id)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_continuous(type = "viridis")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

`species_id` is a categorical variable, but `scale_color_continuous()` supplies a continuous color scale.
`scale_color_discrete()` would give a discrete/categorical scale.
