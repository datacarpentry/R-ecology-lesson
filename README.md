# Data carpentry: R for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. It can be taught in 3/4 of a day (approximately 6 hours).
The lesson starts with some basic information about syntax for the R programming
language, the RStudio interface, and moves through to specific programming tasks,
such as importing CSV files, the structure of data frame objects in R, dealing
with categorical variables (i.e. factors), basic data manipulation
(adding/removing rows and columns), and finishing with calculating summary
statistics and a brief introduction to plotting.
There is also a lesson on how to use databases from R that is intended to be
taught after the SQL lesson, and ideally at the end of a Data Carpentry workshop.

## Prerequisites

The lesson assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio.
Learners should have R and RStudio installed on their computers. They will also
need to be able to install R packages from CRAN, create directories, and
download files.
See [the lesson website](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html)
for instructions on installing R, RStudio, and the required R packages.

## Code handout

There is a [code handout](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/code-handout.R)
that is intended to be distributed to the participants.
This file includes some of the examples used during teaching and the titles of
the section. It provides a guide that the participants can fill in as the lesson
progresses. Participants can also source code from this file to avoid typos in
more complex examples.
