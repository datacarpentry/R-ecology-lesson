# _Data Carpentry: R for data analysis and visualization of Ecological Data_

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. It can be taught in 3/4 of a day (approximately 6 hours).
It is a redesigned version of [the original Data Carpentry lesson](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12684301). 

The initial effort towards this redesign was done by [Michael Culshaw-Maurer](https://github.com/MCMaurer) in another repository in The Carpentries Incubator: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/R-ecology-lesson (now archived). See Michael's notes while preparing the redesign in [the update_plans.md file](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/R-ecology-lesson/blob/main/update_plan.md) of that repository.

The lesson starts with information about the R programming language and the RStudio interface. It then moves to loading in data and exploring how to visualise it with ggplot2. The next episode takes learners through an exploration of data frames and some common data cleaning operations, before discussing vectors and factors. The final episode introduces the flow of data in R, and how to combine operations to select, filter, and mutate a data frame.

## Providing feedback on this lesson

If you teach this redesigned lesson, please [open an issue](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson/issues/new) on this repository to share your experience. 

## Prerequisites

The lesson assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio.
Learners should have R and RStudio installed on their computers. They will also
need to be able to install R packages from CRAN, create directories, and
download files.
See [the lesson website](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html#setup)
for instructions on installing R, RStudio, and the required R packages.
