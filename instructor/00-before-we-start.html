</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>The term “<code>R</code>” is used to refer to both the programming
language and the software that interprets the scripts written using
it.</p>
<p><a href="https://rstudio.com" class="external-link">RStudio</a> is a popular way to write R
scripts and interact with the R software. To function correctly, RStudio
needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.</p>
</section><section id="why-learn-r"><h2 class="section-heading">Why learn R?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-learn-r"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><div class="section level3">
<h3 id="r-does-not-involve-lots-of-pointing-and-clicking-and-thats-a-good-thing">R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that’s a good
thing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-does-not-involve-lots-of-pointing-and-clicking-and-thats-a-good-thing"></a></h3>
<p>In R, the results of your analysis rely on a series of written
commands, and not on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking.
That is a good thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you
collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked
in which order to obtain your results. With a stored series of commands
in an R script, you can repeat running them and R will process the new
dataset exactly the same way as before.</p>
<p>Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear,
and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you
feedback and spot mistakes.</p>
<p>Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of
what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of
the methods you use.</p>

<h3 id="r-code-is-great-for-reproducibility">R code is great for reproducibility<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-code-is-great-for-reproducibility"></a></h3>
<p>Reproducibility is when someone else, including your future self, can
obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same
analysis.</p>
<p>R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code.
If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures
and the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated
automatically.</p>
<p>R is widely used in academia and in industries such as pharma and
biotech. These organisations expect analyses to be reproducible, so
knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.</p>

<h3 id="r-is-interdisciplinary-and-extensible">R is interdisciplinary and extensible<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-is-interdisciplinary-and-extensible"></a></h3>
<p>With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its
capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine
statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the
analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has
packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and
a lot more.</p>

<p>The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your
dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it
won’t make much difference to you.</p>
<p>R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data
structures and data types that make handling of missing data and
statistical factors convenient.</p>
<p>R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data
formats, on your computer or on the web.</p>

effectively.</p>

<h3 id="r-has-a-large-and-welcoming-community">R has a large and welcoming community<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-has-a-large-and-welcoming-community"></a></h3>
<p>Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you
through mailing lists and websites such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" class="external-link">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/" class="external-link">RStudio community</a>, and Slack
channels such as the R for Data Science online community (<a href="https://www.rfordatasci.com/" class="external-link">https://www.rfordatasci.com/</a>).

</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Let’s start by learning about <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" class="external-link">RStudio</a>, which is an Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) for working with R.</p>
<p>The RStudio IDE open-source product is free under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" class="external-link">Affero General
Public License (AGPL) v3</a>. The RStudio IDE is also available with a
commercial license and priority email support from RStudio, PBC.</p>
<p>We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our
computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize
the plots we will generate. RStudio can also be used for other things
(e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we
will not cover during the workshop.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/rstudio-screenshot.png" alt="RStudio interface screenshot. Clockwise from top left: Source,Environment/History, Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer,Console." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>RStudio is divided into 4 “panes”:</p>
<ul><li>The <strong>Source</strong> for your scripts and documents
(top-left, in the default layout)</li>
<li>Your <strong>Environment/History</strong> (top-right) which shows
all the objects in your working space (Environment) and your command
history (History)</li>
<li>Your <strong>Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer</strong>
(bottom-right)</li>
<li>The R <strong>Console</strong> (bottom-left)</li>
</ul><p>The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see
menu, Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Pane Layout). For ease of use,
settings such as background color, font color, font size, and zoom level
can also be adjusted in this menu (Global Options -&gt; Appearance).</p>
<p>One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information
you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally,
with many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file
types you use while developing in R, RStudio will make typing easier and
less error-prone.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder, called the <strong>working
directory</strong>. All of the scripts within this folder can then use
<em>relative paths</em> to files that indicate where inside the project
a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which point to where a
file is on a specific computer). Working this way allows you to move
your project around on your computer and share it with others without
worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts will still
work.</p>
<p>RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its
“Projects” interface, which not only creates a working directory for
you, but also remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate
to it) and optionally preserves custom settings and (re-)open files to
assist resume work after a break. Go through the steps for creating an
“R Project” for this tutorial below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Start RStudio.</li>
<li>Under the <code>File</code> menu, click on <code>New Project</code>.
Choose <code>New Directory</code>, then <code>New Project</code>.</li>
<li>Enter a name for this new folder (or “directory”), and choose a
convenient location for it. This will be your <strong>working
directory</strong> for the rest of the day (e.g.,
<code>~/data-carpentry</code>).</li>
<li>Click on <code>Create Project</code>.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="../files/code-handout.R">code handout</a>, place
it in your working directory and rename it (e.g.,
<code>data-carpentry-script.R</code>).</li>
<li>(Optional) Set Preferences to ‘Never’ save workspace in
RStudio.</li>
</ol><p>A workspace is your current working environment in R which includes
any user-defined object. By default, all of these objects will be saved,
and automatically loaded, when you reopen your project. Saving a
workspace to <code>.RData</code> can be cumbersome, especially if you
are working with larger datasets, and it can lead to hard to debug
errors by having objects in memory you forgot you had. Therefore, it is
often a good idea to turn this off. To do so, go to Tools –&gt; ‘Global
Options’ and select the ‘Never’ option for ‘Save workspace to .RData’ on
exit.’</p>

<h3 id="organizing-your-working-directory">Organizing your working directory<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#organizing-your-working-directory"></a></h3>
<p>Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help
keep things organized, and will help you to find/file things in the
future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects.
In general, you may create directories (folders) for
<strong>scripts</strong>, <strong>data</strong>, and
<strong>documents</strong>.</p>
<ul><li>
<strong><code>data_raw/</code> &amp; <code>data/</code></strong> Use
these folders to store raw data and intermediate datasets you may create
for the need of a particular analysis. For the sake of transparency and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance" class="external-link">provenance</a>, you
should <em>always</em> keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as
much of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with
scripts, rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from
processed data is also a good idea. For example, you could have files
<code>data_raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt</code> and
<code>...plot2.txt</code> kept separate from a
<code>data/tree.survey.csv</code> file generated by the
<code>scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R</code> script.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>documents/</code></strong> This would be a place to
keep outlines, drafts, and other text.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>scripts/</code></strong> This would be the location to
keep your R scripts for different analyses or plotting, and potentially
a separate folder for your functions (more on that later).</li>
<li>
<strong>Additional (sub)directories</strong> depending on your
project needs.</li>
</ul><p>For this workshop, we will need a <code>data_raw/</code> folder to
store our raw data, and we will use <code>data/</code> for when we learn
how to export data as CSV files, and a <code>fig/</code> folder for the
figures that we will save.</p>
<ul><li>Under the <code>Files</code> tab on the right of the screen, click
on <code>New Folder</code> and create a folder named
<code>data_raw</code> within your newly created working directory (e.g.,
<code>~/data-carpentry/</code>). (Alternatively, type
<code>dir.create("data_raw")</code> at your R console.) Repeat these
operations to create a <code>data</code> and a <code>fig</code>
folder.</li>
</ul><p>We are going to keep the script in the root of our working directory
because we are only going to use one file. Later, when you start create
more complex projects, it might make sense to organize scripts in
sub-directories.</p>
<p>Your working directory should now look like this:</p>
<figure style="text-align: center"><img src="../fig/r-starting-how-it-should-look-like.png" alt="How it should look like at the beginning of this lesson" width="100%" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-working-directory">The working directory<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-working-directory"></a></h3>
<p>The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is
the place from where R will be looking for and saving the files. When
you write code for your project, it should refer to files in relation to
the root of your working directory and only need files within this
structure.</p>
<p>RStudio assists you in this regard and sets the working directory
automatically to the directory where you have placed your project in. If
you need to check it, you can use <code>getwd()</code>. If for some
reason your working directory is not what it should be, you can change
it in the RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser where your
working directory should be, and clicking on the blue gear icon “More”,
and select “Set As Working Directory”. Alternatively you can use
<code>setwd("/path/to/working/directory")</code> to reset your working
directory. However, your scripts should not include this line because it
will fail on someone else’s computer.</p>
</div>
</section><section id="interacting-with-r"><h2 class="section-heading">Interacting with R<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interacting-with-r"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the
computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those
instructions. We write, or <em>code</em>, instructions in R because it
is a common language that both the computer and we can understand. We
call the instructions <em>commands</em> and we tell the computer to
follow the instructions by <em>executing</em> (also called
<em>running</em>) those commands.</p>
<p>There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console
or by using script files (plain text files that contain your code). The
console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where
commands written in the R language can be typed and executed immediately
by the computer. It is also where the results will be shown for commands
that have been executed. You can type commands directly into the console
and press <code>Enter</code> to execute those commands, but they will be
forgotten when you close the session.</p>
<p>Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is
better to type the commands we want in the script editor, and save the
script. This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and anyone
(including our future selves!) can easily replicate the results on their
computer.</p>
<p>RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script
editor by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> shortcut (on
Macs, <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> will work, too). The command on
the current line in the script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the
commands in the currently selected text will be sent to the console and
executed when you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You can find
other keyboard shortcuts in this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rstudio-ide.pdf" class="external-link">RStudio
cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE</a>.</p>
<p>At some point in your analysis you may want to check the content of a
variable or the structure of an object, without necessarily keeping a
record of it in your script. You can type these commands and execute
them directly in the console. RStudio provides the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>1</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> shortcuts allow you to
jump between the script and the console panes.</p>
<p>If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a
<code>&gt;</code> prompt. If it receives a command (by typing,
copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Enter</kbd>), R will try to execute it, and when ready, will show
the results and come back with a new <code>&gt;</code> prompt to wait
for new commands.</p>
<p>If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn’t
complete yet, the console will show a <code>+</code> prompt. It means
that you haven’t finished entering a complete command. This is because
you have not ‘closed’ a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don’t have
the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same
number of opening and closing quotation marks. When this happens, and
you thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console
window and press <kbd>Esc</kbd>; this will cancel the incomplete command
and return you to the <code>&gt;</code> prompt.</p>

<kbd>F1</kbd> while your cursor is on the function name. If you are
looking for a function to do a particular task, but don’t know the
function name, you can use the double question mark <code>??</code>, for
example <code>??kruskall</code>. Both commands will open matching help

<p>When you write code in RStudio, you can use its automatic code
completion to remind yourself of a function’s name or arguments. Start
typing the function name and pay attention to the suggestions that pop
up. Use the up and down arrow to select a suggested code completion and
<kbd>Tab</kbd> to apply it. You can also use code completion to complete
function’s argument names, object, names and file names. It even works
if you don’t get the spelling 100% correct.</p>

your machine, but there are many more available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="external-link">CRAN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/" class="external-link">GitHub</a>. To search across all available R
packages, you can use the website <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org" class="external-link">rdocumentation.org</a>. Often, a
generic Google or internet search “R &lt;task&gt;” will send you to the
appropriate package documentation or a forum where someone else has
already asked your question. Many packages also have websites with
additional help, tutorials, news and more (for example <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" class="external-link">tidyverse.org</a>).</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-error-messages">Dealing with error messages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dealing-with-error-messages"></a></h3>
<p>Don’t get discouraged if your code doesn’t run immediately! Error
messages are common when programming, and fixing errors is part of any
programmer’s daily work. Often, the problem is a small typo in a
variable name or a missing parenthesis. Watch for the red x’s next to
your code in RStudio. These may provide helpful hints about the source
of the problem.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/rstudioredx.png" alt="RStudio shows a red x next to a line of code that R doesn't understand." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>If you can’t fix an error yourself, start by googling it. Some error
messages are too generic to diagnose a problem (e.g. “subscript out of
bounds”). In that case it might help to include the name of the function
or package you’re using in your query.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="asking-for-help">Asking for help<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#asking-for-help"></a></h3>
<p>If your Google search is unsuccessful, you may want to ask other R
users for help. There are different places where you can ask for help.
During this workshop, don’t hesitate to talk to your neighbor, compare
your answers, and ask for help. You might also be interested in
organizing regular meetings following the workshop to keep learning from
each other. If you have a friend or colleague with more experience than
you, they might also be able and willing to help you.</p>
<p>Besides that, there are a few places on the internet that provide
help:</p>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?tab=Votes" class="external-link">Stack
Overflow</a>: Many questions have already been answered, but the
challenge is to use the right words in your search to find them. If your
question hasn’t been answered before and is well crafted, chances are
you will get an answer in less than 5 min. Remember to follow their
guidelines on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask" class="external-link">how to
ask a good question</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help" class="external-link">R-help
mailing list</a>: it is used by a lot of people (including most of the R
core team). If your question is valid (read its <a href="https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html" class="external-link">Posting Guide</a>),
you are likely to get an answer very fast, but the tone can be pretty
dry and it is not always very welcoming to new users.</li>
<li>If your question is about a specific package rather than a base R
function, see if there is a mailing list for the package. Usually it’s
included in the DESCRIPTION file of the package that can be accessed
using <code>packageDescription("&lt;package-name&gt;")</code>.</li>
<li>You can also try to contact the package author directly, by emailing
them or opening an issue on the code repository (e.g., on GitHub).</li>
<li>There are also some topic-specific mailing lists (GIS,
phylogenetics, etc…). The complete list is <a href="https://www.r-project.org/mail.html" class="external-link">on the R mailing lists
website</a>.</li>
</ul><p>The key to receiving help from someone is for them to rapidly grasp
your problem. Thus, you should be as precise as possible when describing
your problem and help others to pinpoint where the issue might be. Try
to…</p>
<ul><li><p>Use the correct words to describe your problem. Otherwise you
might get an answer pointing to the misuse of your words rather than
answering your question.</p></li>
<li><p>Generalize what you are trying to do, so people outside your
field can understand the question.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce what does not work to a simple <em>reproducible
example</em>. For instance, instead of using your real data set, create
a small generic one. For more information on how to write a reproducible
example see <a href="https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html" class="external-link">this
article from the reprex package</a>. Learning how to use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=reprex" class="external-link">reprex</a> package is
also very helpful for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Include the output of <code>sessionInfo()</code> in your
question. It provides information about your platform, the versions of R
and the packages that you are using. As an example, here you can see the
versions of R and all the packages that we are using to run the code in
this lesson:</p></li>

how you can use R to analyze data for your own research. However, to do
advanced operations such as cleaning your dataset, using statistical
methods, or creating beautiful graphics you will need to learn more.</p>
<p>The best way to become proficient and efficient at R, as with any
other tool, is to use it to address your actual research questions. As a
beginner, it can feel daunting to have to write a script from scratch,
and given that many people make their code available online, modifying
existing code to suit your purpose might get first hands-on experience
using R for your own work and help you become comfortable eventually
creating your own scripts.</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
