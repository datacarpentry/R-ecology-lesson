[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org) is an open source project, and we
welcome contributions of all kinds: new lessons, fixes to existing material, bug
reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work
under [our license](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/LICENSE.html).
In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as
promptly as we can, and help you become a member of our community.  Everyone
involved in [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org)
and [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org) agrees to abide by
our
[code of conduct](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/CONDUCT.html).


## Working with GitHub

### Submitting Issues on GitHub

If you have an idea about how to improve the lesson, you can submit it as an 
issue on GitHub. If you have multiple unrelated suggestions, it is best to 
open a separate issue for each of them. This makes it easier for the project 
maintainers to discuss and resolve them.

Submitting an issue can count as a contribution
for your instructor training checkout. If your contribution is for instructor 
training, send an email with a link to the issue to 
[checkout@carpentries.org](mailto:checkout@carpentries.org). 
Please note that it is _not_ necessary to point out in the issue's title or text 
that it is a contribution for the instructor training checkout.

### Submitting Pull Requests

You can also suggest changes by modifying the lesson code directly and submitting
your changes as a pull request.

1.  Fork the `datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson` repository on GitHub.  *See the
    "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the screen on the GitHub website.*

2.  Clone that repository to your own machine. (It is also possible
    to make minor edits right on GitHub.) *At your terminal:*

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/your_username/R-ecology-lesson.git R-ecology-lesson
	cd R-ecology-lesson
	git remote add upstream https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson.git
	```

3.  Create a branch from `main` for your changes.
    Give your branch a meaningful name,
    such as `fix-typos-dplyr-lesson`
    or `add-tutorial-on-visualization`. *At your terminal:*

	```bash
	git checkout -b fix-typos-dplyr-lesson
	```

4.  Make your changes to the Rmd file. If you'd like to check the rendered
    version of your changes, you can do one of three things:

	* if you have `GNU Make` installed on your system, type `make` at your shell
      terminal.
	* if you use RStudio, click on the "Knit" button in the top-right corner of
      your editor pane.
	* in other cases, you can type:
      `rmarkdown::render_site("01-intro-to-r.Rmd")` in your R terminal (make
      sure your working directory is at the root of the lesson) to generate the
      corresponding html file.

5.  Commit the Rmd file you edited (`git add file-you-changed.Rmd`, followed by
    `git commit -m "fix typos in dplyr lesson"`), and push your changes to your
    repository on GitHub (`git push origin fix-typos-dplyr-lesson`).  If your
    change affects a lesson, **please only commit and push the `Rmd`
    files**. The rendered versions will be generated by the lesson maintainers
    to avoid merge conflicts.

5.  Send a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch of the
    `datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson` repository for this lesson at
    https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson

If you are new to Git or GitHub, software like 
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) can make this process easier for
you.

If it is easier for you to send edits to us some other way, please
mail us at [checkout@carpentries.org](mailto:checkout@carpentries.org).
Given a choice between you creating content or wrestling with Git,
we'd rather have you doing the former.


## File Locations and Formats

### RMarkdown 

For the R material, lessons are written in RMarkdown (files ending in
`Rmd`). Filenames follow the pattern `00-before-we-start.Rmd`,
`01-intro-to-r.Rmd` and so on. That is, we use two digits followed
by a topic key to ensure files appear in the right order when listed.

A Makefile converts the Rmd files into HTML files that are
processed by Jekyll (the tool GitHub uses to create websites) as
explained in [the README file](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson#readme).

To ensure a consistent formatting of the lessons, we recommend the
following formatting guidelines for RMarkdown files:

* No trailing white space
* Wrap lines at 80 characters (unless it breaks URLs)
* Use consistent capitalization (e.g., R not r, RStudio not rstudio
or Rstudio)
* Function names are written as `function()` while variables are
written as `variable`, and package names as **`package`**.
* Use unclosed atx style headers (see below):

```
## Use this format for headers

And not this format
-------------------
```

#### Formatting RMarkdown Code Chunks

Most R code within .Rmd files is written inside of code chunks. 
Code chunks can have a name and a number of options, but neither is
required. Options are added to a code chunk like this:

` ```{r, chunk_name, option1 = value, option2 = value, ...}`

Throughout the lesson, we use different code chunk options, mostly 
to change when and how the code in the chunks is being executed. 
Below you will find a list of the most common options we use and 
information on how we use them. 
More information on RMarkdown code chunk options 
can be found [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options). When in doubt,
consult the `Rmd` files for examples.

##### `answer = [FALSE | TRUE]`

The `answer` option is used in challenges to hide the content of the chunk
so that the reader needs to interact with the website to reveal it.
The default value is `FALSE`.

##### `echo = [FALSE | TRUE]`

If `echo = FALSE`, the code will be executed and its output will be visible
on the lesson website (unless specified otherwise by the `eval`, `message`, 
or `results` options), but the code itself will not be visible. 
This is useful when writing code for the code handout, because it allows to 
include redundant headings and comments that are not needed in the 
lesson itself, but help to structure and clarify the code handout. 
The default value is `TRUE`.

##### `eval = [FALSE | TRUE]`

If `eval = FALSE` the code in the chunk will not be executed by `R` when
the file is processed to create the lesson website. Accordingly, no output
will be created.
This is useful, for example, when seeing the result of the code is not 
required for the lesson, or when the code chunk contains code that installs 
or loads packages, downloads files, or opens the `R` help window. 
The default value is `TRUE`.

##### `message = [FALSE | TRUE]` 

If `FALSE` messages produced by the code will not be shown.
THis is useful, for example when loading packages like **`tidyverse`** that
output when loaded. By using `message = FALSE`, such output can be hidden.
The default value is `TRUE`.

##### `purl = [FALSE | TRUE]`

Code chunks that have the option `purl = TRUE` will be included in the 
code handout (see below). The default value is `FALSE`.

##### `results = ['markup' | 'hide' | 'asis' | 'hold']`

Determines if and how the text output of a code chunk is formatted.
Useful values are `markup` (to format text output using markup, usually 
formatting it as a code block), `asis` (to write  raw output directly 
into the document without any markup), and `hide` (to hide the output, 
for example when loading data sets).

### Code Handout 

The code handout `code-handout.R` contains code that can be distributed 
to learners.
This is particularly useful for error prone code such as long URLs for 
downloading files.
The code handout is created automatically from the lesson's `.Rmd` files
by `make_code_handout.R`, and we use the `purl()` function from `knitr` to  
create the handout. 
Code that should be included in the code handout must be enclosed in an 
`R` code chunk with the chunk option `purl = TRUE` (see above).
To make the handout more useful, consider including explanatory comments. 

### Data

We don't store data for lessons inside the lesson repositories. For
completed lessons the data should be publicly available in a data
repository appropriate to the data type. For lesson development the
data may be provided in any way that is convenient including
posting to a website, on [figshare](https://figshare.com/), a public
Dropbox link, a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com), or even
included in the pull request (PR). Once the PR is ready to merge the data should
be placed in the [official data repository](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459.v5)
and all links to the data updated.

Raw data go into `data_raw/`. However, at this stage, this folder is
created programmatically and only contain dataset downloaded directly
from the Figshare repository. In other words, it can be safely be
deleted (e.g. using `make clean-data` or `make clean`.)

The `data/` folder only contains data generated/exported by R
code.

### Images 

Images (e.g., screenshots) are stored in the `img/` folder. Graphics
generated by some R code also go into this folder and get the prefix
`R-ecology-`. This latter case is handled automatically with some
knitr options in the `setup.R` file.

### Website Assets

The `site_libs` folder is generated by the **rmarkdown** package and
holds the javascript, css, and fonts used by the website.

We aim to have our lessons be as self-contained as possible. Images and 
other external resources should be included in the repository whenever possible.
